## Purpose
<p>This project is a redo of my earlier project, see this repo on https://github.com/MbuthiaWaKihara/sorting-algorithms-visualizer </p>
<p>After taking new interest in UI/UX design, I picked this project for an attempt at improving UI/UX. Also, I intended to improve state management from the earlier repo, by introducing redux</p>

## Demo
<p>View a deployed version of this repo https://MbuthiaWaKihara.github.io/sorting-algorithms-visualizer-2</p>

<ul>
<li>The app is still not responsive. View is optimum at 90% zoom in mozilla, and 80% zoom in chrome</li>
<li>Notes page has not been re-implemented</li>
</ul>
