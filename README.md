## Purpose
<p>This project is a redo of my earlier project, see this repo on [github](https://github.com/MbuthiaWaKihara/sorting-algorithms-visualizer) </p>
<p>After taking new interest in UI/UX design, I picked this project for an attempt at improving UI/UX. Also, I intended to improve state management from the earlier repo, by introducing redux</p>
